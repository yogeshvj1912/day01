What is the difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2?
Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1 loads resorces one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blockall the other resorces behind it.in contrast,HTTP/2 is able to use a single tcp connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
